What complications can you foresee while doing this exercise?
  1. Perhaps using an Activity -> ActivitySchedule vs. TimeSlot model would be more comprehensive
  2. Allocating and DeAllocating inventory for activities may be handled more comprehensively
  3. Further testing around adjusting availability needed

Would your solution scale?
  1. With further quality analysis and iteration yes.
